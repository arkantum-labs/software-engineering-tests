## Full stack Home Assignment
We would like you to implement the following assignment:

Create a functional asset management server which supports the following APIs:
1.    Get a list of all assets in the warehouse
2.    Update asset details
3.    Add a new asset
4.    Delete an existing asset

*\* it can be any type of asset you like (electronics, books, cookies, magic potions ðŸ¦„ , etc)*


The information about the assets should be persistent.
Each asset should have the following properties:
 - Asset type
 - Asset serial
 - Asset color
 - Asset meta data â€“ a simple json object (hashed) - to mimic proprietary meta data

Create a client for the server. The client should enable to perform the server functionality.

Please note:
Backend should be written in NodeJS.
We prefer TS and NestJS or Express, if possible.

The client should be implemented using ReactJS.

As you implement consider the following best practices:
  - Code readability (donâ€™t use comments, let the code explain your meaning)
  - Code structure
  - Modularization
  - Code that you are proud of
  - User experience
  - 
Implement it in a way that you will feel pleased with your code.
